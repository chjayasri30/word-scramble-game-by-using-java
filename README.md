 🧠 Scramble Game - Java Mini Project

Welcome to the Scramble Game, a simple Java-based word guessing game built using core Java concepts like `ArrayList`, `Random`, `Scanner`, and loops. It's a fun way to practice string manipulation and logic building in Java!

📌 Game Rules

1. The game randomly selects a word and scrambles its letters.
2. You have **3 chances** to guess the original word.
3. If you guess correctly, you win!
4. If not, the game ends after 3 failed attempts.

💻 Features

- Random word selection from a predefined list
- Letter scrambling using `Collections.shuffle()`
- User input handling using `Scanner`
- Attempt-based game logic
- Simple terminal interface
